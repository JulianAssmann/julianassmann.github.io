During my school years, I was part of a team that entered a competition hosted by the [German Aerospace Center (DLR)](https://www.dlr.de/en). We developed a solar-tracking robot that autonomously positions and angles a solar panel to optimize energy collection based on the sun's position. The project involved both custom hardware design and Arduino-based programming. Our innovation earned us first place in the competition and garnered recognition through the Young Innovators Award from the University of Applied Sciences Heilbronn.
