I create German programming language video tutorials, a journey I began at age 14. Initially, I used teaching as a method to deepen my own understanding - after all, explaining concepts to others is one of the best ways to learn. While this passion project has been intermittent due to its time-intensive nature, the channel has grown to reach over 8,500 subscribers and surpass 1,000,000 views. Beyond helping others take their first steps in programming, this endeavor has taught me valuable skills in educational methods, content planning, and multimedia production.
