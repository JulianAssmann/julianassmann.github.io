## Hello, I'm Julian

I am a PhD candidate at [SAP SE](https://www.sap.com/), working in close collaboration with the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/) as part of an industrial doctorate program. Under the guidance of [Prof. Heiner Stuckenschmidt](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/people/professors/prof-dr-heiner-stuckenschmidt/), my research centers on Sustainable AI, where I explore methods to optimize the inference of large-scale AI models. My goal is to significantly reduce their computational and environmental impact without compromising performance, contributing to a more sustainable future for AI technologies.
